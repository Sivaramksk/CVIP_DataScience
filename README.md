Phase 1 - Normal Task
Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in the context of global terrorism involves utilizing data-driven
techniques to gain insights and understanding into patterns, trends, and characteristics of terrorist 
activities worldwide. By employing statistical and visual exploration of relevant datasets, researchers 
and analysts aim to uncover hidden patterns, identify key variables, and generate hypotheses that contribute 
to a deeper comprehension of the complex dynamics surrounding global terrorism.
Phase 1 - Golden Task
Breast Cancer Prediction
The objective of this project is to create a predictive model that can accurately classify breast
cancer cases as benign or malignant based on a set of relevant features. By leveraging
historical data and applying machine learning techniques, we aim to develop a reliable tool for
assisting medical professionals in diagnosing breast cancer.
Phase 2 - Normal Task
Email Spam Prediction
Email spam, also known as unsolicited bulk email (UBE) or junk email, has become a pervasive and persistent issue in the digital age. With the rapid growth of internet communication, email has become a primary means of correspondence, making it an attractive target for spammers seeking to reach a large audience. The proliferation of spam not only inundates inboxes with irrelevant and often malicious content but also poses significant challenges for individuals, businesses, and email service providers.

As a response to the escalating threat of email spam, various methods and technologies have been developed to detect and filter out unwanted messages. These techniques range from rule-based filters and heuristic analysis to more advanced machine learning algorithms. The goal of email spam detection is not only to identify and block spam but also to minimize false positives, ensuring that legitimate messages reach their intended recipients.

In this context, this paper explores the landscape of email spam detection, examining the evolution of methods and technologies employed to mitigate the impact of spam. It delves into the challenges faced in distinguishing between legitimate and unwanted emails and highlights the significance of ongoing research and innovation in the field.
