Phase 1 - Normal Task
Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in the context of global terrorism involves utilizing data-driven
techniques to gain insights and understanding into patterns, trends, and characteristics of terrorist 
activities worldwide. By employing statistical and visual exploration of relevant datasets, researchers 
and analysts aim to uncover hidden patterns, identify key variables, and generate hypotheses that contribute 
to a deeper comprehension of the complex dynamics surrounding global terrorism.
Phase 1 - Golden Task
Breast Cancer Prediction
The objective of this project is to create a predictive model that can accurately classify breast
cancer cases as benign or malignant based on a set of relevant features. By leveraging
historical data and applying machine learning techniques, we aim to develop a reliable tool for
assisting medical professionals in diagnosing breast cancer.
